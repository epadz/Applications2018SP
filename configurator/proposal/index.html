<h1>Project</h1>
<p>
    For my project I will be creating a configurator for renting a carshare. The user will pick a day then be shown all the cars with their availabilities. Next they pick a car and specify a rental start and end time. Finally they confirm the reservation.
    <br />
    Enterprise has a really bad system which is what inspired me to do this.
</p>
<h1>Scope</h1>
<p>
    I will build a full fledged functional web app using React. The coding component is my strength. I wanted to pick a project relatively large in scope so that I could be afforded the ability to put a lot of effort in to design which is why I'm in this class in the first place.
