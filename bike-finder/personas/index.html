        <li>The fact that they are buying a BMX bike from a general retailer, not a specialty store indicates that they likely do not have much experience with the sport and aren't looking to make a big investment - thus we can afford to have such a specific persona for them</li>

        <li>Inspired to acquire a BMX bike because they see friends / professional athletes / people in video games using them</li>
        <li>Impulsive (they're buying a  BMX bike from a general retailer, not a specialty store - probably just a passing interest)</li>
