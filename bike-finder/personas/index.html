    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Look Cool</li>
        <li>Be able to do tricks / functionality</li>
        <li>Quality - not have to worry about bike breaking</li>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Boys</li>
        <li>Age: 16</li>
        <li>Lives in a semi-rural, lower-middle class/ working class suburb near Bakersfield, CA. Will use his BMX bike in his local skate park and in the rural areas near where he lives.</li>
        <li>The fact that he is buying a BMX bike from a general retailer, not a specialty store indicates that he likely does not have much experience with the sport and isn't looking to make a big investment - thus we can afford to have such a specific persona</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Personality</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Likes taking risks</li>
        <li>Impressionable</li>
        <li>Affected by adolescent insecurities / wants to look cool</li>
        <li>Inspired to acquire a BMX bike because he sees friends / professional athletes / people in video games using them</li>
        <li>Impulsive (he's buying a  BMX bike from a general retailer, not a specialty store - probably just a passing interest)</li>
        <li>Below average student</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Limited purchasing ability</li>
        <li>Has delivered pizza for Domino's for the past year and has finally saved up enough to buy this bike.</li>
        <li>Affected by adolescent insecurities / wants to look cool</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Interest in similar activities like skateboarding</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Knowledge</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinks he knows more than he does</li>
        <li>Ambitious</li>
        <li>Professionals (seen in videos etc.) and cooler, older friends are main reference point for what to buy - i.e. wants to be like role models</li>
