    <h2>User Story for Jimmy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As Jimmy, I was to find a cheap, entry level BMX bike so that I can try out the sport, look cool to my friends and feel like my heroes from Youtube videos and TV</li>
        <li>I want to be like my favorite BMX riders so I first check out Mongoose because that's the brand they all ride</li>
        <li>Because I have a tight budget and don't want to have to do too much research, I decide to look elsewhere as there are too many options and the prices are too high on the Mongoose website</li>
        <li>Because I am highly price sensitive and live in a semi-rural area, my first thought for my next move is to check Walmart as I know they have cheap products</li>
        <li>Since technology isn't my strong suit, I search for BMX instead of navigating through the department pages because that seems the most straightforward way to find a bike</li>
        <li>Because my primary interest is price, I sort the results by price as this is the most obvious way to find the cheapest bike</li>
        <li>I am 16 so I narrow down the results to only show adult bikes</li>
        <li>A large motivating factor behind my purchase is vanity / insecurity so I want to find the coolest looking bike / the one that looks the most like what professionals use</li>
        <li>Because my main concerns are price and look, I do not spend a lot of time looking at technical specs and only look at reviews if the bike is poorly rated</li>
        <li>Because I found the bike I want, I add it to my cart</li>
    </ul>
