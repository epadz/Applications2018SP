    <p>
        For the past twenty five years, E.Z. Properties has been a cornerstone of the community. Since our founding,
        Wash U students have been some of our best and most reliable customers. That's why we decided to hold our first Year Without Rent Sweepstakes.
        One lucky winner will receive free rent for a year for one of our 250 apartments in the St. Louis area.
        All you need to enter is a valid Wash U email address so we can make sure you're a student!
        There's no catch - we promise! Just fill out the form below to enter.
